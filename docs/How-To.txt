CleverNotes How-To:


SpellCheck:

SpellCheck can be turned On or Off by going to Preferences > Advanced Settings.

To ignore a misspelled word: Highlight the word, then right-click and select the "Ignore" option.

Because CleverNotes saves files as regular ".txt" files, there's no way to keep track of ignored words over multiple sessions. Every time a file is opened, all misspelled words will be flagged regardless of whether or not they were ignored in a previous session. To prevent this from happening, try adding the word to CleverNotes' WordList.

To add a misspelled word to CleverNotes' WordList: Highlight the word, then right-click and select the "Add to WordList" option.


EasyFormat:

CleverNotes' EasyFormat is a quick and easy way to format your notes using shorthand.
In order to use EasyFormat, simply add the following characters to the beginning of whichever line you wish to format:

"-your text" will result in:

      -  your text

"--your text" will result in:

          -  your text

"---your text" will result in:

                -  your text

CleverNotes will automatically format your text when you press the Enter key.

EasyFormat also works with numbers:

".your text" will result in:

1.  your text

"-.your text" will result in:

      1.  your text

"--.your text" will result in:

          1.  your text

Numbers will continue to increase in value as long as the lines between them are indented past their horizontal position. For example:

      1.  Line One

          1.  Sub-Line One

      2.  Line Two

          2.  Sub-Line Two

Break Line

      1.  New Line One

EasyFormat can be turned On or Off by going to Preferences > Advanced Settings.
